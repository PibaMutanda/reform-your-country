This wiki will explain you how to create a new web project heriting from RYC project

= Introduction =




= Details =

  #  Make a checkout from the ryc project: http://reform-your-country.googlecode.com/svn/trunk
  #  Create your own Dynamic Web Project
  #  In *BuildPath->Libraries* add libraries (web app libraries) choose ReformYourCountry
  #  In *BuildPath->Source* Link sources from *WORKSPACE_LOC/ReformYourCountry/src* and rename the folder (like RYC-src)
  #  Apply the changes
  #  Add a folder in your Project with advanced option "link to alternate location" and the adress must be *WORKSPACE_LOC/ReformYourCountry/WebContent* (i name it RYC-WebContent)
  #  Go in your project properties again and in "Deployment Assembly", add the folders  RYC-src and  RYC-WebContent if they are not present.
    #  The Deploy-Path of RYC-src must be "WEB-INF/classes"
    #  The Deploy-Path of RYC-WebContent must be "/"
    #  You can change them by double-click on the text-zone
  #  Now your project is ready. Just verify the order and export  from your build path. RYC-src must be after your src
  #  If you want to overwrite a file (like home.jsp) Just create the file with the same path but in your WebContent or in your src folder depending of the overwrited file's path.
