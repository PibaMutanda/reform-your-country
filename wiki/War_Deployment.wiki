It's really easy. You just have to overwrite (create a file with the same name in your src/ folder) the config.properties and secret.properties files. You put the values you need there.

Then you create a build.xml in your project at the root folder of the project and inside you write
{{{
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE project>
<project basedir=".">
	<import file="../ReformYourCountry/buildTwoProjects.xml"/>
</project>
}}}
